          <h1>Creative Coding with p5.js </h1>
          <p>The second project shifted focus to animation through creative coding using p5.js, a JavaScript library designed for artists and designers. This project allowed us to unleash our creativity while learning about coding fundamentals.
        </p>
        <p> Key Features and Insights:<br>
        - Animation: We created various animations by manipulating shapes, colors, and movements within p5.js. The library's functions made it easy to draw graphics on the canvas and animate them over time.<br>
        - Utilizing ChatGPT Prompts: By leveraging prompts from ChatGPT, I was able to brainstorm ideas for animations that I might not have considered otherwise. This interaction expanded my creative horizons and provided inspiration for unique visual effects.<br>
        - Understanding Code: Through experimentation with different animations, I gained a deeper understanding of how code operates behind the scenes. I learned about functions in p5.js that control frame rates, object properties, and user interactions.<br>
        - Experimentation: The process involved numerous trials to find the right balance between complexity and simplicity in our animations. This hands-on approach made coding enjoyable as we observed how small changes could lead to significant visual impacts.<br>
        </p>
        <p>This project was not only fun but also instrumental in solidifying my knowledge of animation principles and coding logic.</p>
